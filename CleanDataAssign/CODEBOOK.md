The code book
===========

I put the requirements in the comments in the code to show how each step is done.
I used grep for the pattern "mean(" and "std(" for the mean and standard deviation measures.
I chose not to include the descriptive names in the code but instead wrote a file called descriptive_names.txt
to translate the names, I felt that it's a configuration and a data decision, not part of the algorithm.
